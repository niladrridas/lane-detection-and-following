# Lane Detection and Following

## Description
The Lane Detection and Following project aims to develop a software module that enables a vehicle to detect lane markings on roads and stay within its lane autonomously. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and testing files for the project.

## Key Features
- Lane Detection using edge detection and Hough transform techniques.
- Lane Tracking for continuous lane detection over consecutive frames.
- Lane Following to guide the vehicle along the detected lane.
- Real-time processing for efficient execution.
- Visualization tools for monitoring and debugging.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/niladrridas/lane-detection-and-following>`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd Lane_Detection_and_Following`
3. Run the example usage script: `python examples/example_usage.py`
